summary: Hey everyone!<br /><br />I recently started revising the website. I was not happy with the initial layout, as I tried to mimic the Wordrpess layout we had. I did this because we were already familiar with the layout, so it made navigating for the final presentation easier.<br /><br />I chose to start revising the website now because I have time. The last few months have been quite busy for me. I know that it has been a long time since we made the website and game, but revising the website was something that I wanted to do. I wanted to make this website look more modern and well-designed for future visitors; those who may come to play <strong>PLAYTO</strong>, other students, random visitors, and most importantly, future employers. This website hosts our game, and is a big part of each member's portfolio within <strong>Dreaming Bento</strong>.<br /><br />As part of the website revision, I plan to change the entire layout which includes&#58; the  look of the menu and footer, and how the content is organized in each page. I even plan to bring the "Updates" page and all the posts from Wordpress to this website.<br /><br />I would also like to give credit to Neil Teves as he updated the game late last year, and earlier this year.
