summary: Hey everyone!<br /><br />Yesterday was the graduation ceremony for University of Hawaii at Manoa students. Sadly, I was not able to attend the ceremony or see some of our graduating classmates. However, I did want to let you all know that some of the graduating students are members of <strong>Dreaming Bento</strong>. Both <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/members/" class="link-font">Neil Teves</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/members/" class="link-font">Kayla Mae Abalos</a> passed their classes this semester and have officially graduated!<br /><br />I wish them luck in their future endeavors and I hope you do too.
