summary: Hey everyone!<br /><br />I know it has been a little over a week since an update, so here is a minor update. We were told by Jason Leigh, the Computer Science Professor, to implement a puzzle where we do not just use our stick mode as a form of transportation, and a way around obstacles but to also help complete puzzles using obstacles. I decided to implement my own small section which does this to introduce players to the way of problem-solving and Justin implemented a new puzzle dedicated to this method.
