summary: Hey everyone!<br /><br />It has been a lot of hours, but I think it is safe to say that the website revision is done. I am satisified with the overall look of the website now. The website looks more modern and refreshing than it did before. There is still a big mess with code, but I do not feel like cleaning it up at the moment, as there are other projects I want to focus on. Maybe sometime later, I will come back and cleanup the code but for now, I will leave it as is.<br /><br />As for <strong>PLAYTO</strong>. Well as mentioned earlier, Neil did update the game late last year/earlier this year. Future updates may not happen. The game was a project that brought us together and now we all are working on other projects.<br /><br />To the other <strong>Dreaming Bento</strong> members, if you are reading this, I do wish you all the best of luck on their future endeavors.
