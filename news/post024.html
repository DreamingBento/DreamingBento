<h3>The Verdict</h3>

<p>
    We were able to showcase our videogame to the class, and a panel of judges. There was a lot of well made videogames that were showcased, but the judges still had to make their decisions, as there was only five awards to hand out.
</p>

<p>
    Ultimately, out of a class that consisted of give or take 12 teams, our team won two out of the five awards. We were awarded with <strong>Best Technical Achivement</strong> and <strong>Best Overall Game/Gameplay</strong>.
