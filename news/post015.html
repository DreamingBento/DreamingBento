summary: Hey everyone!<br /><br />I have been working on a new gameplay mechanic, for one of my puzzles. The new mechanics allows <em>Plato</em> to climb walls! I was waiting on Neil to push his updates to the cloud. The sticky system only works on certain walls/platforms that have the script tied to it.
