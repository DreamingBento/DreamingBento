summary: Hey everyone!<br /><br />Just another quick update. Our final presentation for the game happens on 13 December 2017. This means we only have one week left, our final stretch of the semester!<br /><br />Neil is working hard right now, doing some finishing touches on the extended tutorial level. Justin is finishing up his sections, as well as creating and implementing sound effects for the game. Kayla and Kaeli are finishing up on some of the art assets we requested, as well as an animated cutscene for our trailer.<br /><br />As for myself, I have finished what I wanted and am able to do as of right now for the game. However, this does not mean I am done with my part, I am currently working on migrating the website from Wordpress to Github Pages. I am doing this because Wordpress is very limiting in the design of the website, as well as having way too much ads, slowing down the speed of the loading speed of the website. With Github Pages, I will be able to design the website to how I see fit. Neil and I also found out that we are able to host our game demo on Github Pages, which is more reliable than our old method.
