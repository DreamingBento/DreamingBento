summary: Hey everyone!<br /><br />We have a new gameplay video demonstrating our game, <strong>PLAYTO</strong>! This video is for a mid-semester update on our game for the class. The first level has not really changed in gameplay design, but we do now have assets for the tutorial level. I would also like to note that the video features a new level that is an extension of the tutorial level. Justin and I can not take much credit here, as Neil made the level by himself during his spare time. Anyway, here is the video&#58;
