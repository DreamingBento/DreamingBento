<h3>Demo</h3>

<p>
    I would like to point out thate the demo is fully playable on our <em>Play Now</em> page. Do note that the ending of the last level is not fully complete. We did as much as we could during the semester, especially during finals week. If you ever make it near the end, you will see that art assets have not been implemented. Otherwise, thank you for playing if you do try the demo!
