summary: Hey everyone!<br /><br />We just finished our first meeting, and merged our tutorial puzzles and assets together for the game, so we have a playable demo! As much as we would like to build the demo and send share the download, Neil and I are working on hosting the game online. I will update you all once that happens!<br /><br />We also now have set up our plans for our next meeting. Neil, Justin and I are to draw draft puzzles so we can create a level layout in our next meeting. Kayla and Kaeli are to continue working on the concept art and storyboard, as well as drawing up what we, the programmers, want for our puzzles.
