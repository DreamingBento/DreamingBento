summary: Hey everyone!<br /><br />I was able to create a basic item system. The code is kept in the game controller script which is shared through all the scenes. The items are referenced in each scene and then new abilities can be used depending on which items the player currently has on the player inventory.<br /><br />Players can only carry three items at a time and any other items they may get if their inventory is full will go to there inventory box at the home base.
