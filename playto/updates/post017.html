summary: Hey everyone!<br /><br />Our Lead Game Artist, Kayla, has been contacting one of her friends to help create music for our game, since the beginning of our team formation. She requested for him to make us some music by December for the final product. Her contact has finally gotten back to us with theme music sample. Have a listen to a five second snippet!
