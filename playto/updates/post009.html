summary: Hey everyone!<br /><br />Implemented some code that makes the stick tilting mechanic much smoother. Before it was a quick jerk and the game object just suddenly teleports into position but now players can hold down left or right (to a certain degree) and the tilt will translate instead of just appearing in place.
