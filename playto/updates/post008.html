summary: Hey everyone!<br /><br />We just finished another team meeting and finally decided on a name for the game, which is <strong>Playto</strong>. The name is suppose to play on to both of the main characters name, <em>Plato</em>, and the fact that he is a Play-Doh.<br /><br />I know, I know. Puns are not for everyone.
