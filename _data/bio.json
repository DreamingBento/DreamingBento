The endless possibilities and adventures that exist in the world of gaming has captivated me for all of my life. I find progamming and game creation to be very similar to playing a video game; coding is a seemingly endless sandbox of creation that is only limited to the creator's imagination where the only rules are that of the coding language. The problem solving and critical thinking from gaming as a child is an engaging experience that has carried over to my coding career.",

Like many people who major in Computer Science, I found my passion in programming through gaming. In games, we are able to control our actions, and through those actions, shape both the world and overall experience of the game. Much like games, programming not only gives me this ability, but also allows me to share the ability, with other people. Giving them better control, a better experience and overall an amazing product.",
